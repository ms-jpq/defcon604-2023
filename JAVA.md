## prolog

- `++++` Cool as shit

- `++` Fast interpertor spin up

- `+` Shares the same (yes -> continue / no -> abort) execution model as `bash -eux -o pipefail ...`

- `+` `DCG` is vastly more superior to `regex` for parsing complex grammar, esp with recursion

- `-` Poor tooling

- `---` Good luck using it in prod

## python

- `+++++` Legendary stdlib

- `+++` Best built-in argument parser of any language

- `++` Excellent tooling

- `-` Poor pipelining support

## clojure

- `+++` Beautiful language

- `-` Shell programming is orthogonal to Clojure's strengths

- `--` Slow JVM spin up

## perl

- `+++` Available almost anywhere `bash` is

- `++` Cool boomercore language.

- `--` Unicode support hidden behind flags, so nobody uses them, especially in shebangs.

## ruby

- `+++` Most powerful built-in templating of any language (erb).

- `++` Passable stdlib, including decent pipelining & rake (ruby's Make)

- `++` More sane version of `perl`

- `-` Working with raw bytes an after thought

## nodejs

- `+++` Stream oriented + `async function*`

- `++` Fast interpertor spin up

- `---` Stdlib is sucky

## powershell

- `++` Access to `.NET` stdlib

- `-` Poor tooling

- `---` SLOW as hell interpertor spin up for a shell language

## fsharp

- `--` Enterprisy stdlib

- `+` Pretty decent tooling actually

## haskell

- `++` Beautiful language.

- `--` Form over function

- `---` Really slow compile time when running via shebang

## lua

## R

## php

- `--` Is `php`

## rust

- `+` If it passes `#![deny(clippy::all, clippy::pedantic)]`, it work good

- `---` Only ever going to be used to make `build.rs` executable

## kotlin

- `-----` Some how slower than julia at `Hello World`
