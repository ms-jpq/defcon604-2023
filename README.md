# Structured Shell Programming (Recursions, Lambdas, Functional Paradigms)

The proposition is simple: **`SHELL` is the most effective programming technique** you can learn, because it's based on **process composition**, it necessarily works at a **higher level** than say compared to Haskell.

All the code plus the original defcon604 slides are available at [my github](https://github.com/ms-jpq/defcon604-2023)

#### Haskell?

Building block: _Functions_

```haskell
functions . pointfree . compose
```

#### Shell

Building block: _Programs_

```bash
process1 | process2 | process3
```

My goals in this essay isn't to explore the quirks of the `SHELL` programming languages, of which there are many. Rather, this is a distillation of the useful **semantics of process composition**.

## Homoplasies to Structured / Functional / SQL Programming

There is a perception: that `$SHELL` programs are **unstructured**, **primitive**, and **impotent**.

While there is some truth to this, in that the majority of `$SHELL` programming is done rather haphazardly. It is nevertheless a misunderestimation of an entire paradigm.

- The pitch: **It is hard to perform recursion without some coherent structure, and underlying consistency**.

- Through both interesting and constructive examples (with **many recursions**), I will demonstrate the **homoplasies** that `$SHELL` programming has with other more regarded programming paradigms.

## Case Study: Recursive Bash HTTP Server

Before I bore you to death with practical knowledge, there is an _amusing amount of depth_ in this toy HTTP server.

For pedagogical purposes, this is my favorite program. Please allow me to break down the **_interesting bits_**.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env -S -- bash -Eeu -O dotglob -O nullglob -O extglob -O failglob -O globstar

set -o pipefail

ADDR='127.0.0.1'
PORT='8888'
if [[ -t 0 ]]; then
  printf -- '%q ' curl -- "http://$ADDR":"$PORT"
  printf -- '\n'
  exec -- socat TCP-LISTEN:"$PORT,bind=$ADDR",reuseaddr,fork EXEC:"$0"
fi

tee <<-'EOF'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

EOF

printf -- '%s\n' 'HELO' >&2
exec -- cat -- "$0"
```

### `#!`: shebang

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env -S -- bash -Eeu -O dotglob -O nullglob -O extglob -O failglob -O globstar
```

- In UNIX systems, `#!` are the magic bytes at beginning of files that denote executable scripts, and it leads to a path i.e. `/usr/bin/env` as the script interpreter. This is fairly well known.

- This isn't all that interesting, but what's less well known is that many `/usr/bin/env` implements have a `-S`, `--split-string` flag that splits the shebang line, allowing for succinct argument passing. For example, passing in `perl -CAS` to enable greater unicode support.

### `[[ -t 0 ]]`: is stdin `(fd 0)` a terminal?

- The recursion here works by checking if the script is run from the terminal, if so, the script re-spawns itself under a child process of [`socat`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man1/git.1.html), in which it is no longer attached to the terminal.

- The terminal is actually a fairly important concept for in shell programming, as it is the `$SHELL` itself. It poses some **compelling questions**:

1.  - On [`ASCII`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man7/ascii.7.html) and strings: How do you _delete_ a character from the terminal, if the terminal is **just another process**? Surely `stdin` is _append only_.

    - As it turns out, `ASCII` has multiple deletion characters: `BS ('\b')` and `DEL`, what's better, it even has a `BEL ('\a')` character that will blink your terminal.

2.  - So are even the most basic 8bit strings really just text? Or should we view them as _instruction streams_?

    - The latter mental model should prove more fruitful for shell programming. (And understanding Unicode in general)

### `printf -- '%q '`: What kind of format is `%q`?

Two things are true:

1.  **Recursion is difficult without argument passing**.

2.  It is difficult to manually quote arguments in `$SHELL` languages.

#### The solution:

`%q ` **quotes arguments** to `printf` such that they can **`$SHELL` expand back to their logical identity**.

This feature is not unique to `bash` and `zsh`. We can examine a few more languages to reveal their idiosyncrasies:

- **Python**: The quoted string is the most legible of the bunch.

```python
from shlex import join

print(join(("\n ", "#$123", r"\@!-_")))
# '
#  ' '#$123' '\@!-_'
```

- **Ruby**: You can really see the `perl` heritage here, both in syntax and in library names.

```ruby
require 'shellwords'

puts %W[\n#{' '} \#$123 \\@!-_].map(&:shellescape).join ' '
# '
# '\  \#\$123 \\@\!-_
```

- **Bash**: Observe that the quoted string is **a single line**, unlike `python` and `ruby`. This is deliberate, since `bash` like other `$SHELL` languages is fundamentally **line / record oriented**. Line breaks carry special currency in `$SHELL`, and need to be used **judiciously**.

  - Note: this is _NOT POSIX compliant_, due to `$'<string>'` being a bash extension.

```bash
printf -- '%q ' $'\n ' '#$123' '\@!-_'
# $'\n'\  \#\$123 \\@\!-_
```

- **PowerShell**: Wow, such Microsoft, much `UTF16-LE`, very `BASE64`.

  - Note: For escaping in general, `printf -- %s "$STRING" | base64 -d | "$SHELL"` is never a bad strategy. Since `base64 -d` is fairly ubiquitous.

```ps1
# Must be UTF16-LE encoded
$pwsh = @"
...
"@
$argv = @(
  'powershell.exe'
  '-NoProfile'
  '-NonInteractive'
  '-WindowStyle', 'Hidden'
  '-EncodedCommand', [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($pwsh))
)
```

~~applescript is also a valid language, and you can `quoted form of`~~

### `exec -- socat TCP-LISTEN:"$PORT,bind=$ADDR",reuseaddr,fork EXEC:"$0"`

Three üêì (birds) one üóø (line).

- **`exec --`, `EXEC:`**: ["exec\*" family of _syscalls_](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man3/exec.3.html): **replace** current process with new process:

  - As a consequence of this **short-circuiting** behavior, we can author syntactically valid multi-language scripts, i.e.:

#### Julia

- - As long `^#` is a part of the comment syntax.

```julia
#!/usr/bin/env -S -- bash -Eeuo pipefail -O dotglob -O nullglob -O extglob -O failglob -O globstar
#=
set -x
JULIA_DEPOT_PATH="$(mktemp)"
export -- JULIA_DEPOT_PATH
exec -- julia "$0" "$@"
=#

print(@__FILE__)
```

#### Rust

- - Some languages like Javascript or Rust, specifically allow `#!` shebang even if the `#` is not part of the comment syntax.

    - Often, they will have `//` as the comment start, and due to `POSIX` path normalization, we can use `//usr/bin/true;` as a **NOOP**, followed by the actual script.

```rust
#!/usr/bin/env -S -- bash -Eeuo pipefail
//usr/bin/true; rustc --edition=2021 -o "${T:="$(mktemp)"}" -- "$0" && exec -a "$0" -- "$T" "$0" "$@"

#![deny(clippy::all, clippy::cargo, clippy::pedantic)]

fn main() {
// make build.rs executable!
}
```

#### Swift

- - In `BASH` specifically, `exec -a '<arg0>'` is used to set the **first argument** of the new process. Which conventionally is the **name of the executable**. (even under NT!)

    - This enables the polyglot script to _pass-through_ `argv[0]`.

```swift
#!/usr/bin/env -S -- bash -Eeuo pipefail
//usr/bin/true; swiftc -o "${TMPFILE:="$(mktemp)"}" -- "$0" && exec -a "$0" -- "$TMPFILE" "$@"

let arg0 = CommandLine.arguments.first!
print(arg0)
```

- **`$0`**: `argv[0]` (first argument)

  - Conventionally `ARGV[0]` is always present.

  - This has two important implications:

    1. Since we invoke programs by their name, we can use `ARGV[0]` to **perform recursion** as well as dispatch multi-call binaries like busybox.

    2. For scripts, conventionally the name of the script just happens to be the **path to itself**. This allows scripts have **knowledge of their own location**, and access resources relative to itself.

- **`fork`**: [`fork` is another _syscall_](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man3/fork.3posix.html). It **duplicates** the current process. That is to imply, ‚áí **parallelism**.

  - Since `$SHELL` programming is fundamentally **process oriented**, `fork` is the basis for concurrency, rather than threads, or coroutines.

  - Without `fork`, `socat` is unable to handle more than a single TCP connection.

### `tee <<-'EOF'`

`tee<<-'EOF'` is a _here-doc_, it prints content between `EOF‚Ä¶EOF` to stdout. Notably, as a child of `socat`, bash's `/dev/stdout` (file) actually writes to the file descriptor of the **TCP socket** provisioned by `socat`.

- Recall the UNIX mantra: **everything is a file**, and that files are IO streams. We can derive that **files are commutable with other files via IO streams**.

  - Since `std{in,out,err}` are blocking, process composition is blessed by **_implicit end to end back pressure_**.

- Files and **file systems** is a recurring theme in effective `$SHELL` programming, especially with regard to IPC.

  - Take advantage of POSIX atomic transactions: `rename`, `reflink`, `link`, `symlink`, `rename`, `mkdir`, `flock`, etc.

  - Take advantage of "consequence free" directories: [`tmpfs`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man5/tmpfs.5.html) (RAM FS) - `/run`, `/tmp`

`HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n` is the minimal spec compliant HTTP response header, and whatever follows is the response body.

- Curiously we never used `\r\n` in our script, only `\n`, and yet the HTTP server still works.

  - Almost all HTTP clients support malformed responses.

- Exploit The **Postel's law**: "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others".

  - Take advantage of the UNIX world of emergent & ossified protocols.

## Recursion is cool, but who gives a shit

_Who the fuck_ uses **`$SHELL` recursion** on a daily basis?

Probably **((you))**, if you use `SSH`.

```bash
ssh '<user@host>' '‚Ä¶' '<arguments>' '‚Ä¶'
```

```bash
# SSH flow diagram, in a typical interactive scenario
"$SHELL" '->' ssh (client) '->' sshd (server) '->' "$SHELL"
```

However trivial the `ssh` client's arguments are, a login `$SHELL` ‚Üí login `$SHELL` **recursion** always takes place, even in the degenerate case of zero arguments.

Percipiently, every argument passed to the local ssh client i.e. `'‚Ä¶' '<arguments>' '‚Ä¶'` are **evaluated and expanded** by the remote `$SHELL`.

Thus, for non-trivial arguments ‚áâ use `printf -- '%q '`.

### Emergent Protocol -- POSIX sh

Similar to how the ubiquity of `C` made its calling convention the universal [FFI API](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html), the ubiquity of the `int system(const char *command)` has made the `POSIX` `$SHELL` an accidental API in of itself.

For any arbitrary `UNIX` program, if it has a mechanism for spawning processes as a single argument, chances are, the arguments to the parent program are carried over more or less verbatim into
the system `/bin/sh`, or via the `$SHELL` environ.

_i.e.:_

- [`FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='‚Ä¶', fzf --preview '‚Ä¶', fzf --execute '‚Ä¶'`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/fzf.1.html): `fzf`'s preview, execute, and search commands.

- [`GIT_SSH_COMMAND='‚Ä¶' git`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man1/git.1.html): pass args to `ssh` under `git`.

- [`PAGER='‚Ä¶', EDITOR='‚Ä¶', VISUAL='‚Ä¶'`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man7/environ.7.html): various *standard environmental variables*.

- [`parallel -- '‚Ä¶'`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man7/parallel_tutorial.7.html): gnu parallel straight up has a `--quote` command to help with escaping.

- [`rsync --rsh '‚Ä¶'`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man1/rsync.1.html): `rsync`'s tunneling command.

- [`ssh -o ProxyCommand='‚Ä¶'`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/en/man5/ssh_config.5.html): `ssh`'s tunneling command, i.e. `exec openssl s_client -quiet -connect '%h:%p' -servername "$SNI"`, SSL wrapping SSH, for SNI routing through TCP proxies like nginx.

..., and so on.

## Homoplasies to Structured Programming

Taking a leaf out of Nathaniel J. Smith's the excellent essay that captured the raison d'etre of Python's [trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) async framework, and whose features have been [incorperated into the standard library](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90908):

[Notes on structured concurrency, or: Go statement considered harmful](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/)

- ~~Functions~~ processes are the core constituents of structured programming:

  - Stack unwinding ‚Üî process termination ‚áâ guaranteed resource dallocation.

  - Absence of `goto` ‚Üî memory space isolation ‚áâ preservation of error boundaries.

  - Consolidation of concurrent control flows ‚áâ conservation of abstraction.

### `$SHELL` is built from lambdas??

_**YES: Almost everything in `$SHELL` outside of control flow and redirection is a pseudo-process**_

### Case Study: `process1 | process2 | Œª | process3*`

**Objective:** I want to recursively defragment a [btrfs file system](https://btrfs.readthedocs.io).

**Obstacles:**

1. `btrfs defragment -r -- '‚Ä¶'` is not recursive for btrfs [subvolumes](https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Subvolumes.html).

2. `btrfs subvolume list -- '‚Ä¶'` has no filter for readonly (undefragable) subvolumes.

**Solution:**

- **`process1 | process2`**: List all subvolumes.

- **`lambda`**: Print path to subvolume, unless subvolume is readonly.

- **`process3*`**: For each subvolume,

```bash
set -o pipefail

SUBVOLUME="$1"
LIST=(btrfs subvolume list -- "$SUBVOLUME")
PICK=(cut --delimiter ' ' --fields 9-)
PARALLEL=(xargs --no-run-if-empty --null -I % --max-procs 0 --)
DEFRAG=(btrfs -v filesystem defragment -r -- %)

{
  printf -- '%s\0' "$SUBVOLUME"
  "${LIST[@]}" | "${PICK[@]}" | while read -r -- VOL; do
    VOL="$SUBVOLUME/$VOL"
    if btrfs property get -- "$VOL" ro | grep -F -- 'ro=false' >/dev/null; then
      printf -- '%s\0' "$VOL"
    fi
  done
} | "${PARALLEL[@]}" "${DEFRAG[@]}"
```

- Notice for the `Œª` section, only `$SHELL` built-ins was used.

  - `Œª` effectively acts as part of the pipe

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env -S -- zsh

die() {
  printf -- '%s\n' "$0"
  return 88
}

die
printf -- '%s\n' $?
```

## You can write ~~Java~~ `$SHELL` in any language

I wrote the sameish `$SHELL` program in [15 languages](https://github.com/ms-jpq/defcon604-2023/tree/main/5-helo), with some [remarks on each language](https://github.com/ms-jpq/defcon604-2023/blob/main/JAVA.md).
