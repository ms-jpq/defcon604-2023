# Shell Programming For Advanced Dummies (Recursion is good)

---

This isn't a walk through on the particularities of any shell's syntax, but rather is a distillation of _useful semantics_.

It is based on a lightning talk I gave at Vancouver's defcon604.

## What is Shell Programming

There is a distinct difference between **written in** shell and written **for shell**.

Really, shell programming is characterized by _process composition_ as much as say functional programming is characterized by _function composition_.

### Building Block

#### Haskell?

Functions

```haskell
functions . pointfree . compose
```

Note: Haskell would be a lot easier to read if half of its conventional operators didn't work right to left and the other half left to right.

#### Shell

Programs

```bash
process1 | process2 | process3
```
